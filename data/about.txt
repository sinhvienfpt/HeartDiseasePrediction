1.age - age


2.sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)


3.cp - chest pain type - tức ngực
    0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart
    1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart
    2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)
    3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease


4.trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) - huyết áp
    anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern


5.chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl - lượng cholestoral trong máu
    serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides
    above 200 is cause for concern


6.fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) - lượng đường trong máu
    '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes


7.restecg - resting electrocardiographic results - kết quả điện tâm đồ
    0: Nothing to note
    1: ST-T Wave abnormality
        can range from mild symptoms to severe problems
        signals non-normal heart beat

9.exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) - đau thắt ngực khi tập thể dục


10.oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest - tình trạng stress
    looks at stress of heart during excercise
    unhealthy heart will stress more


11.slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -
    0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)
    1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)
    2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart


12.ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy - số lượng các mạch chính

    1,3: normal
    6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now
